Classification Model forCryptocurrencies

In this module I make use of K-clustering technique to classify a wide range of tradable cryptocurrencies. I pre-processed the raw available data to narrow down our universe of cryptocurrencies to those I consider tradable. I make substantial use of the sklearn package in this exercise,for instance, to build our K-cluster model and engineer PCA features. The module counts with visualization of model results for ease of understanding.
